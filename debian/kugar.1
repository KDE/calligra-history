.SH NAME
kugar \- a business report maker for the KDE Office Suite
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kugar
[ \fIgeneric-options\fP ] \fB\-d\fP \fIxml-data-file\fP
[ \fB\-r\fP \fIxml-report-template-URL\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B kugar
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
\fBKugar\fP is a tool for generating business quality reports which can
be viewed and printed.  It includes a standalone report viewer and a
KPart report viewer.  The latter means that any KDE application can
embed the report viewing functionality and that reports can be viewed
using the Konqueror browser.
.PP
Note that simply clicking on a data file in Konqueror will cause Kugar
to create a report (using the template specified in the data file).
.PP
This application is part of the KDE Office Suite.
.SH OPTIONS
Below are the kugar-specific options.  For a full summary of options,
run \fIkugar \-\-help\fP.

\fB\-r\fP \fIxml-report-template-URL\fP
