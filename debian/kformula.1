\fBKFormula\fP is an easy to use formula editor. It provides the basic
input facilities and the support functionality you come to expect of a
KOffice application. But there is more. Some of its most exciting
features are:
.PP
.RS
Easy Greek letter insertion
.PP
Intelligent cursor movement
.PP
Advanced syntax highlighting
.PP
Multi-level undo support
.PP
LaTeX export (copy and paste into a text editor)

KFormula uses the KOffice formula drawing library. If you have to deal
with many formulae you may wish to use a KFormula object embedded in
KWord or KSpread.

This application is part of the KDE Office Suite.
.SH OPTIONS
For a full summary of options, run \fIkformula \-\-help\fP.
