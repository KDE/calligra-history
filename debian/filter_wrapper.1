.SH NAME
filter_wrapper \- invoke a KOffice filter as a separate process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B filter_wrapper
.I constr file storePrefix mimeType nativeFormat config number
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B filter_wrapper
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
\fBfilter_wrapper\fP is a small wrapper program used to invoke a KOffice
filter as a separate process.  This is quite nice for "alpha-quality"
filters which tend to crash from time to time.
.PP
This wrapper can only be used if you use the most simple of all
possibilities to import/export files (via two temporary files).  To tell the
filter manager that you'd like to use this wrapper, please simply
replace \fIImplemented=file\fP with \fIImplemented=bulletproof\fP in your
filter's .desktop file.
.PP
The wrapper gets the information about filtering from the filter manager
as command-line arguments and prints progress and the name of the
temporary file to standard output.
.PP
This utility is part of the KDE Office Suite.
.SH OPTIONS
