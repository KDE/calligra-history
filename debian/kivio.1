.SH NAME
kivio \- a flowcharting program for the KDE Office Suite
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kivio
.RI "[ " generic-options " ] [ " file " ]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B kivio
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
\fBKivio\fP is a flowcharting program that offers basic flowcharting
abilities, but with a twist.  Objects are scriptable, and a backend plugin
system offers the ability to make objects do just about anything.
.PP
Feed it a directory of C++ header files, or even Java files, and let it
generate a graphical class map for you.  Give it a network and let it
explore and map out the network for you.  All this is possible through
the scripting/plugin architecture Kivio possesses.
.PP
This application is part of the KDE Office Suite.
.SH OPTIONS
For a full summary of options, run \fIkivio \-\-help\fP.
