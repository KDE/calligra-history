Krita

Krita is a paint application for raster images. It's also, according to
the Dictionary of Phrase and Fable:

The first of four Hindu periods contained in the great Yuga, when the
genius of Truth and Right, in the form of bull, stood firm on his four
feet, and man gained nothing by iniquity.

In the Mahabharata, the name 'krita' is used in a context where this
can be translated with 'perfect' - the perfect age.
