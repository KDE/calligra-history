Issues:
    Double Clicks mixed with single clicks causes the underlying value to change.
      There is a hack implemented that delays mouseRelease setValue calls.
      However, it makes the widget "feel" slow. Need better solution.

    Need to implement Auto-Repeat when holding down mouseover buttons.

    Clipping isn't working on some styles(Plastique). Resulting in double borders.

    Drawing focus highlight isn't working. Although some styles draw it
    automatically for drawing CE_SpinBox. The call in paintEvent seems to
    have no effect...

    Typing is buggy
