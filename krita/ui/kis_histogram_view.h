/**
 * This class displays a histogram. It has a list of channels it can
 * select. The easy way is to display channelStrings() to the user,
 * and then use a setActiveChannel with the integer the same as the
 * one the selected string in that stringlist has. If the selected one
 * is a producer, the histogram will automatically display all its
 * channels, and color them if that is possible.
 *
 * You can also set the channels manually, just don't forget that the
 * displayed channels all need to belong to the same producer! If you
 * set them manually, don't forget to set the (non)usage of color as
 * well.
 *
 * You can either set this to use a specific layer, or use a specific
 * histogram. With the latter, some functionality will disappear, like
 * listProducers(). Setting a histogram will discard info on the
 * layer, and setting a layer will discard info on the histogram.
 *
 * XXX: make beautiful, for instance by using alpha and a bit of a
 * gradient!
