/**
 KisMask is the base class for all single channel
 mask-like paint devices in Krita. Masks can be rendered in different
 ways at different moments during the rendering stack. Masks are
 "owned" by layers (of any type), and cannot occur by themselves on
 themselves.

 The properties that masks implement are made available through the
 iterators created on their parent layer, or through iterators that
 can be created on the paint device that holds the mask data: masks
 are just paint devices, too.

 Masks should show up in the layerbox as sub-layers for the layer they
 are associated with and be ccp'able and draggable to other layers.

 Examples of masks are:

 - filter masks: like the alpha filter mask that is the most common
                 type of mask and is simply known as "mask" in the
                 gui. Other filter masks use any of krita's filters to
                 filter the pixels of their parent. (In this they
                 differ from adjustment layers, which filter all
                 layers under them in their group stack).

 - selections: the selection mask is rendered after composition and
   zooming and determines the selectedness of the pixels of the parent
   layer.

 - painterly overlays: painterly overlays indicate a particular
   property of the pixel in the parent paint device they are associated
   with, like wetness, height or gravity.

   XXX: For now, all masks are 8 bit. Make the channel depth settable.
