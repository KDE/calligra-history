- tools/designer/src/components/lib - QDesignerComponents::createPropertyEditor() created property editor 
for QDesignerPropertyEditorInterface

Everything compiled into QtDesignerComponentsd4.dll

We base koproperty on this example: examples\itemviews\editabletreemodel

compare to DesignerEditorFactory::createEditor()

=== API changes in 2.0 (compared to 1.X) ===
Editor
- Editor class renamed to EditorView
- now based on model/view items and QTreeView
- Editor::clear() removed; use changeSet(0) to clear the visual contents;
  clear the property set in Set object to clear the data
- EditorView::changeSet() has changed its signature to 
  (Set *set, SetOptions options = 0) 
  from changeSet(Set *set, bool preservePrevSelection = false);
  use EditorView::PreservePreviousSelection as the option instead of 
  preservePrevSelection == true
Factory
- Factory objects do not need parent (are owned by FactoryManager)
- implementation of custom factories happens by using Factory::addEditor() 
  and similar functions; used interfaces are EditorCreatorInterface,
  ValuePainterInterface, ValueDisplayInterface
  and helpers: Label, EditorCreator, LabelCreator
CustomProperty
- custom property API (CustomProperty) replaced with 'composed' properies API; 
  implementation of subproperties moved to factory itself 
  thourgh offered ComposedPropertyInterface and ComposedPropertyCreatorInterface
  (e.g. size/rect/point types use this API)
Set
- Set is now based on QHash<QByteArray, Property*>
- a lot of members of Set::Private is now private and accesors are added instead
Set::Iterator
- Set::Iterator is now based on QHash<Property*>::ConstIterator,
  not on an ascii dict iterator from Qt3. 
- Added Set::PropertySelector for easy iterating over selected properties.
Buffer
- Buffer(const Set* set) constructor changed to Buffer(const Set& set).
- declaration/definition moved to Buffer.h/Buffer.cpp

Property
- removed Property::Dict typedef, use QHash<QByteArray, Property*> 
  for cleaner code.

TODO:
-port lines like this in Property.cpp:
d—>custom = FactoryManager::self()—>createCustomProperty(this);
